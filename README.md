# CSGOFixes-SP
A partial SourcePawn implementation of CSGOFixes, contains the following CS:GO fixes:

- Re-enables lag compensation inside of a game_ui by stopping the FL_ONTRAIN flag from being added ([Reference code](https://github.com/perilouswithadollarsign/cstrike15_src/blob/master/game/server/game_ui.cpp#L292))
- Fixes the game_ui Deactivate input crashing the server with a null activator by removing an incorrectly implemented warning message ([Reference code](https://github.com/perilouswithadollarsign/cstrike15_src/blob/master/game/server/game_ui.cpp#L173))
- Fixes player_speedmod from disabling players flashlights by removing the `FlashlightTurnOff()` call ([Reference code](https://github.com/perilouswithadollarsign/cstrike15_src/blob/master/game/server/player.cpp#L8165))
- Fixes the filter TestActivator input crashing the server by hooking the function and blocking execution if `inputdata.pActivator` is null ([Reference code](https://github.com/perilouswithadollarsign/cstrike15_src/blob/master/game/server/filters.cpp#L65))
- Fixes grenade explosions where the thrower left before explosion crashing the server if tested against numerous possible damage filters that lack null attacker checks
- Fixes parented triggers firing OnStartTouch every tick while touched, this also fixes the well-known "stack damage" bug.
- Forces all entities (not just templated ones) to delete their script handle if it exists, thus mitigating a game stringtable leak.
